MEMORANDUM OF DISCOVERY
1943-05-27/53(k)
Dr. Richard Krauss, Associate Director of Research, Biopathology Unit

NOTE: This memorandum summarizes ongoing research and should not be
interpreted as a statement of fact.  Distribution is limited to
addressees without authorsâ€™ written approval.

Further development of research avenues described in memo
1942-05-11/18(f) suggest with HIGH PROBABILITY that viral sample Beta
7n has EXTRATERRESTRIAL ORIGIN.  Detailed analysis of chemical
composition matches no signature of known terrestrial life.  Human
lethality and infectious capabilities undetermined at present.

Introduction to E. Coli for baseline reactivity revealed high
toxicity.  Similar results with other bacteriological samples.
Introduction to various animal tissues revealed little to no reaction
with the exception of primate neural cells, where curious protein
binding activity and neurotransmitter secretion was observed.  Further
analysis required to understand precise binding mechanisms and
reactive properties.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 

  (a) Continue present line of inquiry.
  (b) Acquire second sample from location Echo Lima Bravo 3 for comparison.
  (c) Impose quarantine and limit laboratory access to essential personnel.
  (d) Notify chain of command, possibly including POTUS, of preliminary
      findings and suggest further instructions.
  (e) Authorize identification of human test subjects to assess lethality
      and infectious capabilities.
